### Checkpoint 1

* Link to my github repository is https://github.com/githubForProj/githubForProj.github.io
* I choose https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810024501 as the dataset. I would consider using Canadian data from December 2022 to December 2023.
* The reasons why I use this dataset are: 1. The size of this data set is large enough and the features are rich enough. 2. I am very interested in how the retail price of products changes over time.
